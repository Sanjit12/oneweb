                    I am a computer programmer and web developer. I have worked with popular programming
                    languages like <strong>C/C++, Python, Java, C#, PHP and JavaScript</strong>. I started to learn
                    programming when I was in 1st semester. I started by learning C language, one of the most
                    powerful programming languages till now. Then I moved to C++ and Object oriented programming.
                    After getting a taste of OOP and seeing how great it was I moved to Java which
                    is a pure object oriented language. But everything changed after I got myself into python.
                    When I started to learn python I saw that it is one of the most powerful and yet easy language
                    to learn. Then I devoted myself in learning most of python. Python has one of the most popular
                    web framework <strong>Django</strong>. I have developed this site using Django. Python has the best
                    libraries for machine learning. I want to work on machine learning in the future.
